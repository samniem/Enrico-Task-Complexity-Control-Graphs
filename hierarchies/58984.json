Here’s a whole gallery of the ‘She Shed’: a tiny home specifically for women, in all of its myriad designs. In the middle of all the hustle in bustle, of preparing meals and getting the kids ready for school, of holding down a job and raising a family, of wearing multiple hats in the run of a day, this is something every woman dreams of – a tiny house space to call her own.  The ‘She Shed’ is a micro cottage for women only. It’s a place where no-one else ever goes. It’s a small sanctuary she can decorate to her heart’s content, a place where she can unwind, where she can listen to music, where she can hear herself think. The She Shed is a calm oasis in the middle of a stormy day, a tiny retreat just a few steps away, in the back yard, in the garden, just under the willow tree. If you’ve been dreaming of this tiny home designed just for you, then this beautiful picture gallery is sure to give you a few ideas so that you can easily create your own.   \n\nThe She Shed is a brand new trend that is sweeping across the tiny house movement and beyond. It’s the female version of the “man cave”, a specialized tiny space where women can escape to whenever the stresses of everyday life get too much. Initially designed as a garden shed or tiny cottage you could easily plant in your backyard, the She Shed is for those women who need time on their own, even if it’s just a few minutes or hours a day, and it’s perfect for napping, reading, writing, gardening, painting, sculpting, dancing, meditating, bird-watching, and anything else you can dream of.  There are no rules with the She Shed’s design.        \n\nOver here, you will find the Serenity Shed, camouflaged in greenery and ivy, with large bright windows to sit in and dream from, watching all of nature meander by. Or how about the Antique Shed, made from glass windows and doors that have been carefully recycled and assembled into place. It’s like a transparent haven awaiting your presence.  For those of you who love life in the trees, how about the Treehouse Shed with its soft lighting and bed-on-wheels that you can roll outside onto the tiny patio, or in for a cozy snuggle.  Imagine spending an afternoon up here, napping or reading a book, or perhaps slowly sipping a glass of wine. No one will ever find you up here with the birds in the treetops. Or for the creative ones, how about the Craft Shed?  This is the perfect art studio where you can paint, craft, write, or engage in any of your favourite hobbies with all of nature to inspire you, and without ever being disturbed. If you need a peaceful, quiet space to take your best friend when she’s over for a visit, how about the Girlfriens Shed?  Here, you can both sit back and enjoy a cup of tea and a private conversation without interruption.  These are just a few of the tiny house She Sheds you’ll discover, each with its own unique style and purpose.\n\nIf you enjoy this article on the She Shed, a tiny home designed specifically for women, then you can find lots more like it over at the “Life Daily” website. Life Daily is a lifestyle, world, and popular culture blog that offers top stories on the latest trends, including tiny house living, unique small house plans, and tiny house design, as well as articles on daily life, celebrity news, humorous anecdotes, and so much more.*",
