# HCI-task-complexity-control-graphs
These control graphs are usable to measure interaction structure on user interfaces and are particularly relevant to the field of human-computer interaction and computational interaction

## Getting started
To get started please refer to main.ipynb file as this project was done using Jupyter.

In order to browse examples you can access a particular Rico ID screenshot or hierarchy under the respective folder names.
The corresponding graph can be found under the graphs folder. The up-to-date plots of the complexity computation summaries are available under the results folder. 

## Brief Background
This code was generated as part of my Master's thesis research project, where the purpose was to generate task complexity control graphs for mobile interfaces in a large scale setting.
