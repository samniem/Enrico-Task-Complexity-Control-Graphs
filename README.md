# HCI-task-complexity-control-graphs
These control graphs are usable to measure interaction structure on user interfaces and are particularly relevant to the field of human-computer interaction and computational interaction

## Getting started
To get started please refer to main.ipynb file as this project was done using Jupyter.

## Brief Background
This code was generated as part of my Master's thesis research project, where the purpose was to generate task complexity control graphs for mobile interfaces in a large scale setting.
