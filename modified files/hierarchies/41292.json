This Agreement is subject to the laws, regulations, orders, and decrees of the United States which may be imposed from time to time restricting the import/export of the Products to/from the United States.

The remedies at law of either party in the event of default or impending default by the other party in the performance of any terms of this Agreement will not be adequate, and such terms may be specifically enforced by a decree for specific performance, injunction or other appropriate equitable relief.  The failure of Vertifi to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement will in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor will it affect Vertifi's ability to enforce any provisions of this Agreement.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter set forth herein and supersedes all prior oral and written agreements between the parties with respect thereto and may only be amended in writing by the parties.\n",
