For details, please see our Privacy Statement located at www.autodesk.com/privacy and specific Privacy Notices and Data Collection Notices in our applications.\n\n In order to support ongoing product improvement efforts, Autodesk receives aggregated product usage information about this application from a third party analytics provider: Mixpanel. This information consists of: product launch and closure which allows us to calculate length and number of application sessions; application commands and operations used; as well as general device information such as OS version and device type. \n\n We use the Mixpanel software agent, which collects information and then presents the data to us in aggregated form. The Mixpanel software agent collects the following data: agent version, platform, SDK version, platform timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, device identifier, iOS Identifier for Advertising, iOS Identifier for Vendors, Media Access Control (MAC) address, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), Model (non-iOS), manufacture (non-iOS) and OS version of device (non-iOS), session start/stop time, events, errors and page views (for example, clicking on buttons or links, and whether or not it worked, all of which is reported to us in aggregate), locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone, and network status (WiFi, etc.). \n\n Mixpanel uses unhashed IFA (Apple ID for Advertisers) as the identifier for iOS devices and a hashed ID of device characteristics as the identifier for Android devices. Note that Mixpanel will see Internet Protocol (IP) address, device type, locale and time zone of the user through the HTTP request to send information. For clarity, Autodesk does not receive geo-location data (i.e. GPS coordinates). \n\n Your Choices: If you would like to opt-out so that data is not sent to Mixpanel and then aggregated for Autodesk, please take the following steps depending on what type of device you are using. iOS device: Go to the in-app settings and switch the in-application toggle to “off” to prevent data being sent to Mixpanel. Alternatively, if the app does not have in-app settings, go to device settings and switch the in-application toggle to “off” to prevent data being sent to Mixpanel. Android device: Go to the in-app menu settings and uncheck the “approve data collection” box. \n\n You may also opt-out of all analytics collection by Mixpanel across ALL applications on your device (including non-Autodesk applications) as follows:\n\n Mixpanel – as explained in the Mixpanel privacy policy, located at http://Mixpanel.com/privacy/ or by going to the Mixpanel End User Opt-Out page located at http://Mixpanel.com/optout. \n\n",
